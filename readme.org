* Emacs PKGBUILD For ECFPAW (EPFE)

I will be using this package build to get a working, Emacs installing
for my configuration of Emacs [fn:1]. I have simply forked the AUR
PKGBUILD [fn:2].

I will try to make sure to get *ALL* dependencies installed through
this single package. I also need this because I have find myself using
Distrobox/Toolbox Archlinux containers often and I need to install additional
packages to get it working.
